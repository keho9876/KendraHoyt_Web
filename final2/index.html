              <p>I am currently in my senior yeat at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a major in Art Practices and a minor in Creative Technology and Design. I am learning
                and working towards building a career within design, but I'm still very much in the exploration phase. I have a
                 passion for color and texture, while working with them to create coehisive and beautiful combinations. I do love to paint and draw, but mostly as hobbies. I really enjoy and
                 want to dive deeper into creating digital content and organizing for design concepts.</p>

        <p>I was born and raised in Vail, Colorado. Growing up I deticated my time towards the sport of
  ski racing and attended the Vail Ski and Snowboard Academy 6th-12th grade. I have a little
  sister, Taylor, who is three year younger than me. My source of happiness comes from living
  in the present moment! My mom passed away my senior year of high school, so it's just me,
  my sister, and my dad Brian. We currently have two family cats, Dusty and Ellie. My cat is Ellie
  and my sisters cat is named Dusty. We use to have the BEST family dog named Yoohoo, but
  she passed away last November.</p>

                    professionals I shadowed included design consultants and sales associates who taught me their best approaches for
