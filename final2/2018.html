          <p>While creating the “Primary and Secondary Color Scales,”I had also created two separate color scales, exploiting each of primary and secondary colors. Using acrylic paint and starting with the primary colors I mixed each of the three with one another and constructed the secondary colors. My second scale analyzed the hues of these colors. Using a variety or grays, I found different temperatures within each color.  Lastly, My color wheel displays the primary and secondary colors and a variety in their intensity.</p>

              <h3>Monochromatic Color Scheme (still life painting)</h3>
              <p>“Blossom,” my still life painting was painted from the perspective of a blossoming flower in a vase. There were two different sources
                  of back/left side light which created value and definition thought my piece. Using only the hue of red, I was able to create the
                  space of illusion and emotion through expression. The dominant color red, when mixed portray different values, creates many
                  pink tones along with rusty purple. This colors typically represent love and affection was flowers express these emotions. </p>

              <h3>Complimentary Color Scheme (leaf painting)</h3>
              <p>“Drift,” my Leaf painting was inspired by the autumn leaves and unique colors and diversities they offer. I loved working with the light primaries and their additive mixtures. The blue
                background contradicts the warmer colors in the leaves while showing unity with green tones. </p>

              <p>These prints were made based off the idea of a locket and the female figure.
              The oval-shape symbolizes the the shape of the necklace, the color scheme
              is very feminine, along with a female figure. This technique of art and the
              concept behind it really ties together. Lockets signify the olden day woman
              and reflect a bit of the woman in that time.</p>

                  part of my identity and representing myself through past experiences
                  highlights my inner child. I have always categorized myself as different then
                  others because of the way I have portrayed myself and my distinction between
                  they way others see me and I see  myself. Through the work of photoshop I was
                  able to place myself into older outdated photos, and in doing so the idea of
                  time reference is displayed. Capturing myself in these old fashioned photos
                  contrasts my past through the view of a historical past and contributing to the
                  awareness of who am I.</p>

                others. By placing myself, as a child, in photos before my time it emphasizes
                the idea of time relativity and symbolizing the time frame in which I
                associate my self in. When looking at these photos, I want my views to see a
                point in my life that reflects a part  of who I am but  makes the connection
                that I am not  longer this person. </p>

                    <p id="purp2"> Through the use of metal, I have created a stair way which leads to confusion.
                        The form of a traditional stair case is meant to lead you somewhere, where as
                        in my work, the objective is to draw your attention to the abstract matter of
                        where are you going.  The movement displayed creates an unrealistic
                        representation as to our outcomes and leaves us with the idea that our
                        subjectivity is what we are following. The basic structure that is holding the
                        piece together is the also the structure of the stairs itself. The idea that the
                        stairs are the first motion to moving forward creates a form of stability but as
                        your eyes move up and around the object the lines blur between where the
                        stairs stop. The curved and twisted metal pieces can be representations of
                        obstacles that one must face while also relating to the possibilities moving
                        forward.</p>

                      connections and draw their attention to the raw act of movement in a short
                      period of time. Each clip only lasting about ten seconds displays the amount
                      of movement that is produced around us in that brief moment. While the

                      of background noise which is to allow the viewer to slow down and examine
