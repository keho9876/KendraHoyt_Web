You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.","The only impossible journey is the one you never begin.","The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.","That which does not kill us makes us stronger","If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.","Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.","The best way to predict the future is to invent it.","Change your thoughts and you change your world.","Happiness is not something ready made.
