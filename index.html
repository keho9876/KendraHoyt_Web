  <section id="intro">
      <p>I am currently in my senior yeat at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a major in Art Practices and a  minor in Creative Technology and Design. I am learning and working towards building a career within design, but I'm still very much in the exploration phase. I have a passion for color and texture, while working with them to create coehisive and beautiful combinations. I do love to paint and draw, but mostly as hobbies. I really enjoy and want to dive deeper into creating digital content and organizing for design concepts.</P>
