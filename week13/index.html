            <p>I shadowed staff and learned advanced techniques involving
            high-end European furniture and design. The design
            professionals I shadowed included design consultants and
            sales associates who taught me their best approaches for
            different clients. I was responsible for organizing fabric and
            material samples as well as cleaning and arranging
            showroom displays, furniture, and decor. I supported specific
            projects by organizing files, preparing meeting spaces, and
            updating documentation and reports for official business
            records. I was responsible for restocking inventory and
            assisting with administrative tasks that helped me better
            learn industry processes. I became more efficient in working
             in both team and individual environments. I also provided
            assistance to others in meeting deadlines and participated
            in weekly staff meetings and team-buildingevents.</p>

          <p>I traveled to the Showrooms in downtown L.A. with the Lacy’s
          manager on several occasions. I assisted in selecting new
          products and brands that fit in with the Lacy’s aesthetic,
          helped photograph possible new inventory, and gave general
          input on what brands and styles would appeal to the store’s
          younger demographic. I helped in the store with restocking,
          organizing, cleaning, and working the floor during the busy
          season.</p>

          taking customers to their seats, taking their food and drink
          orders, and running items to customers. I excelled at
          checking in with customers frequently and engaging with
          them. I was responsible for bussing my tables and setting
          them up for the next customers. At the end of the night, I
          helped with closing down the restaurant and with cleaning.</p>
