          <section id=about>
            <p>I am currently in my senior yeat at the University of
      Colorado Boulder, with a major in Art Practices and a
      minor in Creative Technology and Design. I am learning
      and working towards building a career within design,
      but I'm still very much in the exploration phase. I have a
      passion for color and texture, while working with them to
      create coehisive and beautiful combinations. I do love to
      paint and draw, but mostly as hobbies. I really enjoy and
      want to dive deeper into creating digital content and
      organizing for design concepts.</p>
