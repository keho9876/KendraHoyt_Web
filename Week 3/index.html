      <h3>What is Ski Racing?</h3>
        <p>Alpine ski racing is an action-packed sport that mixes speed, agility, balance, coordination, and tactics. The sport consists of four primary events: downhill, super G, giant slalom, and slalom, plus the combined or super-combined that matches downhill and slalom into one event.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Downhill: Downhill is the highest-speed and longest event in ski racing and involves the fewest turns. Each racer only completes one run, and the skier with the fastest time is the winner. As in all alpine events, skiers are timed to one-hundredth of a second and any ties stand as that.</li>

          <li>Super-G: Super-G is short for super giant slalom. The race course is shorter than the downhill but longer and faster than the GS. The skier with the fastest time in one run is the winner.</li>

          <li>Giant Slalom: Giant slalom or GS is similar to the slalom but with fewer gates, wider turns and higher speed. As in slalom, skiers make two runs down two different courses on the same slope on the same day. The times of both runs are added together, and the fastest total time determines the winner.</li>

          <li>Slalom: Slalom is the shortest race and includes the most turns. Each competitor makes one run, then the course is reset on the same slope but with positions of the gates changed. The same day, those skiers qualifying for the second run make their run. The skier with the fastest combined times of the two runs is the winner.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Athletes get started in alpine ski racing by learning to ski at a local resort and taking ski school lessons to learn basic skills. Recreational racing programs like NASTAR provide a great platform for an introduction to alpine ski racing. Local U.S. Ski & Snowboard Clubs are the primary starting point for aspiring athletes, providing an introduction point with knowledgeable coaches and officials to guide them along the development pipeline.</p>

      <h3>The History of Ski Racing</h3>
        <p>Alpine skiing, skiing technique that evolved during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the mountainous terrain of the Alps in central Europe. The International Ski Federation (FIS), world governing body of the sport, first recognized downhill racing in 1930, and the first world championships for men's downhill and slalom events were held in 1931. Women's events were added in 1950. The first Alpine event to be included in the Olympic Winter Games was the combined, which made its debut in 1936 at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. The first giant slalom Olympic competition took place at the 1952 Games in Oslo, Norway, and the supergiant slalom was added at the 1988 Games in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. That same year the combined, which had been removed from the roster of Olympic Winter events in the 1940s, returned as an official event. It was dropped for 1998, however, in favor of two new events; combined slalom (a slalom run and a giant slalom run) and the combined downhill (a supergiant slalom run and a downhill run).</p>
